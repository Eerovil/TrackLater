# How to contribute

* Post an issue about anything
* After creating an issue you can also start to work on your own pull request. This could be a module or general improvements.

# Coding conventions

* Use basic PEP8 style for python.
* Add type hints if you can. If you can't, it's also fine. Mypy and flake8 are used to validate code.
