# TrackLater

Forgot to track your time for work? TrackLater helps you track time after-the-fact by combining clues and showing your day on a simple timeline view.


# Implementation notes

Every module separates their issues, time-entries and projects by 'group'. This makes inter-module communication simple: e.g. commits made in the git repository for group x will be attributed to the corresponding Toggl project for group x.

Groups are arbitrary and decided by the user when creating their settings file. A good way to choose your amount of groups
is to create a group for each client/work project.

An important backbone for TimeLater is https://github.com/sourcegraph/thyme.
The thyme module assumes an implementation where every day is stored in a file named YYYY-MM-DD.json. It's recommended to set up an automatic thyme tracking script for this.

# Settings guide

Each module has their own settings dict, containing a settings dict for each group. There is also
a 'global' key for non-group specific settings.

This example settings file contains two groups: 'group1' and 'group2'. In the example workers workflow,
group1's issues are fetched from Jira while group2's issues are from Taiga.io. Time tracking (for billing) is done through
Toggl. Also, both groups happen to have their own workspaces on slack, and obviously their own git repositories.
